		my passion in development, I have wanted to take on a multi-layered full-stack project that really pushes me to \
		my limits in terms of development and skills.  I know that if I embrace the challenge of trying to code a website \
		that really means something to me from a passion standpoint it will help me make the push I need to the next level \
		as a web designer and developer.  Stay tuned for more . . . ",

		title: "No Creative Restrictions",
		content: "I always assumed that writing a blog would be easy.  After all, when I compared the task of putting \
		together eloquent web-prose to building the website from the ground-up, how difficult could spewing out a few \
		chunks of digital text be?  Very difficult, it turned out.  Sure, it seemed daunting to navigate through the \
		endless arrays of tutorials, technically dense web explanations, and books that only seem to tangentially discuss \
		the problem you’re trying to code your way around.  In many ways, though it seemed more daunting to find meaningful \
		things to express on this platform -- things that would (in my head at least) inspire me to see this project to its \
		completion.  The difficulty lies not in crafting the pieces but in releasing my apprehension to let my thoughts flow \
		without inhibition.  Up until this point, I have exercised a level of restraint in my writing that in many ways has \
		stifled the creative direction of my work, but no more.  If I’m going to use content creation as the driving force for \
		software engineering projects  then I need to substantially lower the bar for my raw creative output.  This article will\
		be the first to be uploaded the the website via a text file and JSON.",
